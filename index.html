        Hello & welcome to my personal website. My name is Brandon Lanzarin; and in this site, I will tell you some of my interests and where I come from.

   <h2 id="where-i-come-from">About me</h2>
      <p>
<h4>I am 15 years old. I was born here in the US, but both my parents are from Mexico. For the first two years in my life, I lived in Miami, then my parents and I moved back to Mexico. For about 7 years, I stayed in Mexico in a pueblo located in Durango, called Pasaje. I lived there for a while but then we moved to Torreon, Coahuila. I don't remember the elementary or kindergarten I went to when I was in Mexico, but I do know the ones I was in here in the US. I went to Citrus Grove Elementary for 3rd-5th grade, Ponce De Leon Middle School for the 6th-8th grade; and I'm now currently in 9th grade in Coral Gables Senior High.</h4>
